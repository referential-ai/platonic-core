# Platonic Core Architecture

Platonic Core is the harness kernel for bounded agent execution.

## Kernel stance

Sans-IO: core is the loop, the ledger, and the boundaries. Nothing in core performs IO.

- The run loop is a pure state machine: feed it an event, get the next state plus typed commands (`request_model`, `execute_tool`, `await_approval`, ...).
- Hosts (CLI, daemon, gateway app) perform IO and feed results back as events.
- Interruption and approval are states, not callbacks.
- Replay is re-feeding the recorded event stream: zero model calls.
- No silent fallback is structural: every model call crosses the typed command/event boundary and is fully recorded — recording is never optional. Provider-selection policy activates at the second provider.
- No async runtime coupling. Trait seams appear only at the second concrete implementation.
- Decision boundary: a host choice that changes security, approval posture, context contents, provider/tool choice, replay, or audit semantics becomes a typed, recorded policy/event/command in core. Mechanical detail (retry timing, pooling, supervision, transport) stays in the host.

## Concurrency model

Core is single-threaded and synchronous. Concurrency is a host concern.

- Each run is an independent state machine value: no shared state, nothing to lock.
- Hosts (the `plato-agent` daemon) schedule many runs: one lightweight task per run, IO awaited host-side, results fed back as events. Multi-agent means many runs, not a threaded kernel.
- Event ordering matters per run only; one task per run gives it for free.
- Independent machines parallelize across runs automatically if CPU-bound work ever appears; core is untouched either way.
- Cross-run coordination (provider rate limits, global budgets/WIP caps, approval queues, append idempotency) is host/store concern — never locks in core. When such a choice changes a run's outcome, it enters that run's ledger as policy/event input.

## Clean room boundary

Core owns semantics; apps own mechanics. `platonic-core` (plus typed adapter crates, once forced into existence) is the clean room: sans-IO contracts, exhaustive proof. `plato-agent` and other app shells are pragmatic application code.

- Apps may be pragmatic about how, never about what: anything semantic crosses the boundary as typed commands, events, and policy — or it did not happen.
- Dependencies point inward only; the clean room never depends on app code.
- Promotion is by proof, not appetite: app code moves inward only when the decision-boundary rule catches it carrying semantics. Core does not grow to feel bigger.
- Proof gradient: clean room requires exact event/replay assertions; app zone gets smoke tests and manual verification.

## Boundary

In scope:

- run and turn identifiers
- typed context fragments and context packs
- model-facing messages
- tool-call proposals
- effect classes
- policy decisions
- structured tool results
- durable harness events

Out of scope for core:

- Discord/Slack/SMS gateways
- cron scheduler
- desktop UI
- model-provider implementations
- memory backends
- skill packages
- MCP server/client implementations
- filesystem/process/browser tools

Those belong in outer crates or apps.

## Module layout

The core crate is split by harness boundary, not by implementation convenience:

```text
src/lib.rs       public module surface and re-exports only
src/error.rs     shared error types
src/ids.rs       string-backed identifier newtypes
src/message.rs   model-facing message primitives
src/context.rs   lane-labeled context primitives with budget validation
src/policy.rs    effect classes and policy decisions
src/tool.rs      tool-call and tool-result boundary types
src/event.rs     durable harness event ledger
src/run.rs       pure run/turn state machine
```

Keep modules narrow. If a module starts pulling in IO, provider clients, runtime
executors, platform adapters, or storage dependencies, the feature probably
belongs in an outer crate.

## Core concepts

### Agent unit

A bounded agent unit (`AgentId`): not a personality blob, but an execution identity with policy, tools, and state scope. Deep-vocabulary name: henad — docs only, never identifiers.

### Run

A durable execution instance. A run is event-log-first. Transcripts, metrics, replay, and audit views are derived from events. The run loop lives in `run` as a pure state machine; hosts drive it. `RunCommand` (desired effects) is a separate type from `HarnessEvent` (recorded facts); replay applies events only, so it can never re-emit IO.

### ContextPack

A bounded context bundle of lane-labeled fragments:

- `system_contract`
- `current_task`
- `tool_schemas`
- `recent_turns`
- `retrieved_context`
- `artifact_summary`
- `policy`

The assembler must validate budget before a model call. No hidden prompt growth. One total token budget per pack today; per-lane budgets arrive with the context assembler.

### ToolCall

The model authors only a `ToolProposal`: registered tool name plus JSON input. The host/registry validates the input and attaches the `EffectClass` to form the `ToolCall` with a stable call id. Effect is never model-declared. `ToolCall.input` is the proposed input verbatim after validation; normalization or default expansion happens during execution, not in the recorded call. The registry itself lives outside this crate; core tracks the boundary.

### EffectClass

Current default posture:

- `read_only` → allow
- `workspace_write` / `network` → require approval unless policy grants it
- `external_side_effect` / `secret_access` → deny by default

### ToolResult

A structured result with:

- short summary
- JSON data
- artifact refs
- model/user/both visibility

Large raw output should be stored as an artifact and summarized for the model.

### HarnessEvent

The durable ledger. Initial events include:

- `run_started`
- `context_built`
- `model_requested`
- `model_responded`
- `tool_call_proposed`
- `policy_evaluated`
- `approval_granted`
- `approval_denied`
- `tool_started`
- `tool_finished`
- `tool_failed`
- `run_finished`
- `run_failed`

Events are recorded wrapped in `RecordedEvent { seq, occurred_at_ms, event }`; hosts supply both fields — core never reads clocks. `seq` is per-run and contiguous from 0; the run machine rejects gaps and regressions. Store append is idempotent on `(run_id, seq)`; ordering across runs is a store concern. Correlation: tool events carry `call_id`; model request/response pairs carry a per-run `step` counter. Ledger variants are never cargo-feature-gated: one schema, always readable.

Future storage backends can persist these events to SQLite, Postgres, files, or an append-only log.

## Possible vocabulary, not committed modules

Hermes-shaped needs not every embedding wants. None exists until a run forces it; each enters as events/types only — engines stay outside core.

- delegation — parent/child run linkage with budget inheritance (plausible early).
- compaction — context compression proposed/applied as recorded policy events; never silent (plausible early).
- memory — retrieval query/hit types entering via the `retrieved_context` lane; never a store (wait).
- scheduling — job/trigger/triage vocabulary so unattended runs route findings to triage, not user spam (wait).

Cargo features, if ever, gate helpers only — when a second embedding needs a different subset (one-shot CLI runner vs persistent daemon).

## First proof

The contract is sharp because scripted fake-host tests drive these through `run` with exact state, command, and event assertions:

- happy path: propose → approval required → granted → executed → finished;
- denial path: denied → no `execute_tool` command ever emitted;
- failure path: tool fails → typed failure recorded, run ends failed;
- ordering: out-of-order events rejected; no commands after a terminal event; context budget validated before any model request;
- replay: re-applying the log reproduces final state with zero model calls and zero tool executions.

The v0.2 machine intentionally proves one model turn and at most one host-validated tool call, then finish/fail. Feeding tool results into later model turns and defining multi-proposal semantics are deferred to issue #4.

No new crates for this; a fake host in tests is enough.

## Planned crate split

Possible workspace shape:

```text
platonic-core       typed kernel primitives
platonic-provider   model-provider adapter traits
platonic-tools      tool registry and schema validation
platonic-store      event store implementations
platonic-replay     replay/caching engine
plato-agent         CLI/product agent built on Platonic
```

Do not create these crates until the core contract needs them.
